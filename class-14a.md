## What Google Learned From It's Quest to Build the Perfect Team

1. **What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?**
	- Group norms; behaviors that are explicitly started or implicitly agreed upon within a given group that defines how the group behaves and interacts with one another. The behaviors that helps a group bond.

	- Empathy; how team members treat each other. Having good emotional intelligence and being able to gauge how others feel based on tone of voice, expressions, and other nonverbal cues. Being able to feel safe to be yourself and remain true to who you are among your teammates.

	- Communication; Everyone should have an equal voice and speaks in roughly the same proportion. Equality in distribution of conversational turn taking. No one should feel like they are being excluded or as if their opinion &/o input does not matter. Being able to speak up and remain unafraid of judgement or repurcussions from your team.


2. **Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.** My last job as a team lead for Wave Fundraising was the most comfortable I've ever felt among a team. A lot of the behaviors that were described within the article honestly described our team perfectly. The work we were doing was to sign people up to become donors for the ACLU to help fight back against the wave of anti-abortion laws that were being passed during the summer (2022). By virtue of doing that kind of work we knew that a lot of our personal values were already in line with each other's and because of that there was almost no conversation that was too difficult or too strange to have. To be honest, a lot of conversations that were had would probably cross a lot of boundaries in almost any other setting but the group norms amongst ourselves were a lot more open and accepting. Every morning we would start with a team huddle and discuss recent happenings as well as the plans and goals for the day, which usually at some point devolved into casual chit chat - but that chatter only strengthened our bonds as people and teammates. A lot of my teammates were queer and even though we worked in Seattle they would often face harassment on the streets. We relied on one another to keep each person safe and keep their mental state in a good place. It was at the same time some of the most physically and mentally exhausting work I've done because of the amount of harassment and difficult people we interacted with on a day to day basis but at the same time it was some of the most fulfilling work I've ever done and hands down the best team I've ever worked with - which made the bad days worth it and the good days even more incredible.

3. **What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members** Teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety are collectively more smart because tough questions are not shied away from and also more efficient because everyone's morale and overall mood is improved which makes the team members feel like the work they are doing is worthwhile.
