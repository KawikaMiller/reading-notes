## SQL vs NoSQL

1. **What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?** "Complex query intensive environments". Databases that follow a specific schema / format but might have a lot of information to query.

2. **Give a real world example.** Something like a student database would be a good real world example. Every student might things like a id, first name, last name, year (freshman - senior), overall gpa, etc. For a large school, there might be hundreds or thousands of students and querying that database for specific data might be complex but its made managable because each 'student' in the database follows the schema.

3. **What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?** "Hierarchal data" - things that follow a key-value pair schema of storing data, similar to JSON data. NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data sets.

4. **Give a real world example.** Something like a database of favorite creatures from all forms of media. If each entry in the database is a key-value pair, then our key might be something like "bigfoot", or "xenomorph" and their respective values could be objects with various information about them. Unlike the 'students' example in question 2, 'bigfoot' and 'xenomorph' probably don't have a lot of overlapping/shared qualities so it would make more sense for them to be described by objects that have properties that are unique to each creature.

5. **Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?** NoSQL

6. **Which type of database is best for scalability?** Non-Relational Databases

## SQL vs NoSQL (video)

1. **What does SQL stand for?** Structured Query Language

2. **What is a relational database?** A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. [source](https://www.oracle.com/database/what-is-a-relational-database/)

3. **What type of structure does a relational database work with?** Tables

4. **What is a ‘schema’?** Schema is esentially the format that each entry of a SQL database should follow. If SQL databases are made of tables, all of our table headers are collectively what define the 'schema'

5. **What is a NoSQL database?** A flexible, non-relational database that does not have a schema.

6. **How does it work?** Key-value pairs of data are stored into 'collections' rather than 'rows' in a table.

7. **What is inside of a MongoDB database?** A series of 'collections' with various key-value pairs inside of them, individually known as 'documents'

8. **Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.** MongoDB because the data being stored does not have to follow a schema.

9. **What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?** 
- Potential duplicates of data
- Sometimes having to update new/overlapping data in mulitple areas 

## Things I Want To Know More About

- At what point should I start to consider scalability? 
- How big of a database does it take to warrant database/server scaling?
- What are some signs / indicators that we should learn towards a SQL or NoSQL database for any given project?
