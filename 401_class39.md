# Redux Toolkit (RTK)

## [Redux Toolkit (RTK)](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/introduction/getting-started)

1. What concerns are addressed by Redux Toolkit?
- The complicated nature of configuring a Redux Store
- Needing too many supplemental packages to get Redux to behave in the way developers needed it to
- Redux requires too much boilerplate code

2. What does configureStore() do?
- Provides a simplified configuration for a `store`. It combines slice reducers and adds whatever middleware you supply.

3. How would I use createSlice()?
- You would use `createSlice()` to make an object that has a name, initial state value, and reducers / actions that are relevant to a specific section , or 'slice' of the global state. You could set this to a variable and then use that variable when you figure your store.

## [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/getting-started.html)

1. What is Mobx?
- Mobx is another state management tool that keeps things simple and scalable.

2. How does MobX make it “impossible” to produce an inconsistent state?
-  "Make sure that everything that can be derived from the application state, will be derived. Automatically"

3. How would we build a reactive user interface?
- By using the `makeObservable` function and passing in the argument `this` - in reference to whatever thing we want to make reactive. To be more explicit we can also use the  `observable` and `computed` keywords.

```
makeObservable(this, {
  todos: observable,
  pendingRequests: observable,
  completedTodosCount: computed,
  report: computed,
  addTodo: action,
});

```

## Tutorial
1. What take-away(s) did this tutorial provide?
- RTK can be used by JS, Angular, and Vue 
- RTK provides developers with a more streamlined and simple process of creating Redux stores & reducers.
- By default it comes with `redux-thunk` as middleware and access to the Redux DevTools
- We can add additional middlewares to `configureStore()`
