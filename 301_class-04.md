# Reading - Class 04

These notes will cover what a controlled component is in regards to React Forms and why it's important to use a component's state for the input's value. This will also briefly explain the ternary operator and how to use it instead of `if`.

## React - Forms

1. **What is a ‘Controlled Component’?** An input form element whose value is controlled by React. 

2. **Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.** We should update the state with their responses as soon as any change is made to the input's value so that we can render any necessary changes to the screen / components.

3. **How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?** The input's value would be set to 'this.state.value' and then the event handler function would call 'this.setState(value: event.target.value)' in order to set 'this.state.value' to whatever we are typing in the input element.

## The Ternary Operator 

1. **Why would we use a ternary operator?** Because it simplifies the `if` conditional logic into one line and makes it easier to read while accomplishing the same thing.

2. **Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:**

x === y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false)
