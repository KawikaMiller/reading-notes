# Reading - Class 14b : CSS Transforms

## CSS Transforms

1. **What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?** It allows the developer to do things like rotate, scale, translate, or skew an element in 2D or 3D.

2. **Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.** We could slightly rotate an `<h1>` element or maybe an `<image>` that was a logo of some kind to give a webpage a certain kind of loose/fun/wacky vibe and make it seem like a less rigid place to be.

## CSS Transitions & Animations

1. **What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?** CSS transitions allow us to manipulate the appearance &/o behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, like when something is hovered over or focused. For example we could have some red text that changes to blue when a mouse is hovered over it.

2. **How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?** CSS animaitons allow us to manipulate the appearance &/o behavior of an element by using keyframes to make those changes over time. Transitions provide a change from one state to another, while animations can have multiple points of transition on different key frames.
