# [Graphs Cheat Sheet](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-35/resources/graphs.html)

- Graphs are a non-linear data structure. 
- Consisting of a collection of `vertices` (think of these as nodes) connected by "lines" known as `edges`.

## Vocabulary
- `Vertex` : Otherwise known as a "node"; An object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices
- `Edge` : The thing that connects two nodes
- `Neighbor` : Any nodes that are connected to another node via edges
-  `Degree` : The number of edges connected to a vertex

## Undirected Graphs

![Undirected Graph](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-35/resources/assets/UndirectedGraph.PNG)

- `Undirected Graph` : Each edge is undirected or bi-directional.

*In the example graph above, Node `C` is connected to `A`, `E`, and `B` - there are no "directions" given to point to a specific vertice.*

## Directed Graphs

![Directed Graph](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-35/resources/assets/DirectedGraph.PNG)

- `Directed Graph` : Every vertice is directed to another vertice. Direction is specified.

## Completed Graphs

- `Completed Graphs` : When all vertices are connected to all the other vertices

## Connected Graph

- `Connected Graph` : All vertices have at least one edge

![Connected Graph](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-35/resources/assets/ConnectedGraph.PNG)

## Disconnected

- `Disconnected Graph` : Some vertices may not have edges

## Acyclic Graph

- `Acyclic Graph` : A directed graph without cycles
- `Cycle` : When a vertice can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself

## Cyclic Graph

- `Cyclic Graph` : A graph that cycles through itself
- `Cycle` : When a vertice can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself

## Adjacency Matrix

- `Adjacency Matrix` : Represents a graph via a 2-dimensional arary. If there are `n` vertices, then the matrix is a `n * n` Boolean matrix.
  - Each row and column must represent a vertice in the graph
  - The value at any given (x, y) coordinate must either be `0` or `1` to represent if there is or is not a connection (edge)

- `Sparse` : when a graph has very few connections
- `Dense` : when a graph has many connections

## Adjacency List

- `Adjacency List` : A collection of linked lists or an array that lists all of the other vertices that are connected

![Adjacency List](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-35/resources/assets/AdjList.PNG)

## Weighted Graphs

- `Weighted Graph` : A graph with numbers ("weights") assigned to the edges

*Weight List - you must include the wieght and the name of the adjacent vertex*

## Graph Traversal

- `Breadth First` : Starting at a root node, visit all nodes that are cloest to the root as possible and then traverse outward level by level until you have visited all the nodes.
  - Because some graphs can be cyclical, this can potentially result in an infinite loop. To prevent that, we add each visted node to a `visited` set which we can reference to prevent us from traversing a node multiple times.

  ![Breadth First](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-35/resources/assets/BreadthFirst.PNG)


*How Breadth First Traversal Works*
  ```
  ALGORITHM BreadthFirst(vertex)
      DECLARE nodes <-- new List()
      DECLARE breadth <-- new Queue()
      DECLARE visited <-- new Set()

      breadth.Enqueue(vertex)
      visited.Add(vertex)

      while (breadth is not empty)
          DECLARE front <-- breadth.Dequeue()
          nodes.Add(front)

          for each child in front.Children
              if(child is not visited)
                  visited.Add(child)
                  breadth.Enqueue(child)

      return nodes;
  ```

- If there are any disconnected nodes (such as islands) with the graph data structure, they will not be traversed.

- Breadth first only outputs the nodes that are connected in some relation to the root that you pass in.

---

- `Depth First` : Starting at a root node, we push each node into a Stack to visit all nodes

**Algorithm**
- `Push` the root node into the Stack and mark as visited.
- Start a while loop that runs as long as the stack is not empty.
- `Pop` the top node off of the stack and check its neighbors.
- If a neighbor hasnâ€™t been visited, push it onto the stack and mark as visited.
- Repeat until the stack is empty.
