# React Native

## [Getting Started with React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started)

1. Name three Core Components of React Native and describe what they do.
- `<View>` : Essentially a div. Supports  flexbox, style, some touch handling, and accessibility controls.
- `<Image>` : Displays images
- `<TextInput>` : Allows the user to enter text

2. What problem does React Native solve (why call it native)?
- It allows developers to rely on a single code case that can used to make a consistent experience across multiple platforms (e.g. Android and iOS)

3. What are the building blocks of a React Native app? How does that compare to a React app?
- React Native uses React Native components as its building blocks for a React Native app - meaning we have some *pre-made* components available for us to use.
- Whereas a *React* app does not necessarily have these components available to you.

## [Expo](https://expo.io/)

1. What solution does expo provide?
- Expo brings together the best of mobile and the web and enables many important features for building and scaling an app. [source](https://docs.expo.dev/core-concepts/)

2. Expo tries to manage as much of the complexity of building apps as possible, which is why we call it the ____ workflow.
- "Bare"

3. What is the difference between React Native and Expo?
- Expo allows us to write our code in JavaScript and does a lot of work behind the scenes for us so we don't have to waste time managing config settings for Andriod/iOS specific issues.

## [Expo Snack](https://snack.expo.io/)

1. Checkout this tool. What does snack allow you to do?
- This is essentially like `replit` except that it's aimed directly at testing React Native / Expo

## [Ejecting](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/expokit/eject)

1. What does “eject” mean within the context of Expo?
- It is used in Expo to describe leaving the cozy comfort of the standard Expo development environment, where you do not have to deal with build configuration or native code
