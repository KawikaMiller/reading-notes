# Authentication

## [Securing Passwords](https://thehackernews.com/2014/04/securing-passwords-with-bcrypt-hashing.html)

1. **Explain to a non-technical friend how you would safely hash and store a password:**
- Hashing is basically like translating your password into an new, 'alien' language. The computer takes your regular, human-language, password and runs it through an algorithm so that now the letter 'a' is represented in the alien language by '38MU', the number '1' is represented by 'J8FA', etc. So now, if anyone were to ever view the database of passwords they would be in that 'alien language' instead of a human langauge - which makes storing passwords much more secure against any potential malicious activity.

2. **What is Bcrypt?**
- The are various types of hashing algorithms, Bcrypt is one of them and is one of the stronger methods of hashing.

3. **Why might you using something like Bcrypt?**
- Bcrypt makes use of a `work factor` which can determine how slow the hash function will be - meaning that different work factors will generate different hash values in different time spans, making it extremely resistant to brute force attacks.

## Things I Want To Know More About
- Are BCrypt and PBKDF2 hashing algorithm the standard? From this article, it seems like they are the more 'secure' method so are there any pros/cons to using these algorithms as opposed to the other ones mentioned (MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512, SHA-3)?
