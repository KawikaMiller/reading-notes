# Redux - Asynchronous Actions

## [Async Actions](https://redux.js.org/advanced/asyncactions)

1. **Why use Redux middleware?**
- Because reducers handle *synchronous* actions and any *side-effects* (read: asynchronous actions) should be handled with Redux middleware

2. **Consider the Redux Async Data Flow Diagram. Describe the flow in your own words.**
- An event is triggered on the UI which invokes a callback function - `dispatch()`. From there, the action is fed into the middleware where it can do asynchronous things like make an API call. Once the asynchronous operation returns its response, the middleware then dispatches another action - which can invoke a (slice) reducer that will update the (slice) state. Finally, the updated state triggers the UI (React) to update it's components

3. **How are we accommodating async in our Redux app?**
- By using the Redux 'thunk' middleware which allows us to write async logic that can dispatch actions and read store state as needed.


## [Thunk Middleware](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk)

1. **Why would you need redux-thunk middleware?**
- To perform asynchronous operations that affect the store state

2. **Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a ____ instead of an action.**
- Function

3. **Describe how any return value from the inner thunk function will be made available.**
- The return value from an inner thunk function will be available as the return value of the `dispatch` itself.
