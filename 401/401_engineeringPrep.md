## Discussion Questions

1. **What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?** As someone who wants to lean more towards front-end work, I think my eye for design / affinity for art is a strong trait that distinguishes me from other developers.

2. **What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?**

- Doing more psuedo-code to define what I want to create &/o what I need to accomplish

- Taking a step back, revisit my whiteboard / wireframe, and see if I can break the problem down into smaller pieces  

- Walking away from my computer and taking a short break, get a snack, play with my dog, etc.
