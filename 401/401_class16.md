# AWS: Cloud Servers

## [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)

1. What is an EC2 instance?
- A virtual server in Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for running applications on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure [source](https://www.techtarget.com/searchaws/definition/Amazon-EC2-instances#:~:text=An%20Amazon%20EC2%20instance%20is,Web%20Services%20(AWS)%20infrastructure.)

2. Name 2 use cases for EC2:
- Run cloud-native and enterprise applications
- Train and deploy machine learning applications

3. Provide 1 reason to use ECS isntead of a service such as Heroku, Digital Ocean, or Render.com:
- They are the only cloud service to offer 400 Gbps ethernet networking

1. Where can we find EC2 on the AWS Console?
- Under the `Compute` section

2. Explain the general difference between T2 Micro and XL:
- The `t` family of `Amazon Machine Image`s (AMIs) are cloud servers which have virtual pc components (cpu, ram, storage, etc.) that offer a general use experience - wheras some other families might be more focused on computation power or storage space. The `micro` vs `xl` just explains how powerful each individual virtual component has. For example, the `t2.micro` offers only 1GB of ram and the `t2.xlarge` offers 16GB of ram.

3. Explain a "Compute Cycle" to a non-technical friend:
- Imagine you order a pizza from your local pizzeria and they tell you it will be there in x-amount of minutes and the pizza arrives exactly in that amount of time - the delivery process is basically a compute cycle. A Compute cycle essentially explains how long it takes an application to serve content to a user from the cloud's environment. The factors that play into how quick the delivery will be are things like how fast can the driver go, how quickly can the pizza be made and cooked - whereas with a compute cycle it depends on things like the CPU's processing power &/o how extensive is the database you have to search through.

## [Elastic Beanstalk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrwxAScdyT0)

1. What is Elastic Beanstalk?
- An easy-to-use service that deploys, manages, and scales web-apps and services for developers.

2. Describe the relationship between EC2 and Elastic Beanstalk:
- You just choose what kind of EC2 instance (AMI) you want to use and Elastic Beanstalk will automatically handle the rest of the infrastructure.

3. Name some benefits of using Elastic Beanstalk:
- Automatically handles scaling, load balancing, provisioning, application health monitoring. Allows you to maintain control of any / all of the resources that power your application. Allows you to just focus on app development instead of managing the infrastructure.
