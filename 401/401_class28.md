# Component Lifecycle

## [useEffect Hook](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect#reference)

1. What is the main intended use case for the useEffect hook?
- The useEffect's main intended use case is to synchronize with some external system - like if a component needs to connect to a network or a third-party library.

2. How does the effect’s logic interact with the component?
- The logic of an effect will run the very first time it is added to the DOM and then once again after every re-render. The useEffect hook also has optional dependencies (i.e. specific values from `props` and `state`) which be compared with it's previous value to determine whether or not the `useEffect` hook should execute.

3. What is the importance of the return value from the effect’s logic function?
- The `useEffect` can optionally return a *cleanup function* which helps to clear up unwanted behaviors and optmizes application performance (i.e. preventing memory leaks) [source](https://blog.logrocket.com/understanding-react-useeffect-cleanup-function/)

## Reflection

1. What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?
- I want to know how to use the `useEffect` hook to implement logic similar to what would happen in `componentDidMount` &/o `componentDidUpdate` with class components.

## Things I Want To Know More About
- How would I know when I do or do not need some kind of clean up code?
