# Class 01

## Introduction to Node.js

1. **How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?** When you visit a website there are 3 main ingredients that make up what you see: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These ingredients are mixed together and presented to you as the website itself. The HTML and CSS are *what* you see whereas JS is more *how* you interact with the website. Traditionally, JavaScript would only be able to do it's thing *inside* of the browser/website but by using Node, we can allow JavaScript to do it's thing *outside* of the browser/website.

2. **What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?** It esentially means that Node.js is capable of taking JavaScript code and executing, or *running* it. Without a runtime, any JavaScript code would just be lines and lines of text. When we use a runtime, it takes all that JavaScript and gives it meaning so that our computers know what to do with it.

3. **What is Node used for?** Node is typically used to run JavaScript code on a server instead of directly in a web browser/website.

## Additional Questions

1. **Looking ahead at this module's course schedule, what do you look forward to learning?** I'm definitely looking forward to learning more about Authorization and Authentication because I feel like I only got to dip my toes into it during 301. Also very interested in AWS and React functional components.

2. **What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?** By the end of 401, I want to:
- Be able to write my own tests for the apps that I'm building
- Understand how to use AWS and cloud based systems
- Understand how to use Socket.io
- Be able to create my React apps strictly with functional components
