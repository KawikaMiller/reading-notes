These notes will explain Lists & Keys within React, the Spread operator, as well as how to pass functions through props in React components

## React - Lists and Keys

1. **What does .map() return?** `.map()` executes a callback function for each element of an array and then pushes the return value of each invocation of the callback function into a new array, and then returns that new array.

2. **If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?** Whenever we want to display JavaScript within our JSX we need to wrap the JavaScript element within curly braces. (e.g. <li>{element}</li>)

3. **Each list item needs a unique ____.** Key.

4. **What is the purpose of a key?** Keys give elements a specific identity which is useful when we want to identify which elements have changed / added / removed.

## The Spread Operator

1. **What is the spread operator?** The spread operator, `...`, allows us to use each item of a given array as the argument for a function. 
```
Math.max(1,3,5) // Uses multiple numbers as arguments, returns 5
Math.max([1,3,5]) // Uses an array as an argument, returns NaN
Math.max(...[1,3,5]) // Uses spread operator and an array as an argument, returns 5
```

2. **List 4 things that the spread operator can do.** 
	- Copy an array
	- Adding to state in React
	- Combining objects
	- Concatenating or combining arrays

3. **Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.**
```
const charArr = [ 'a', 'b', 'c'];
const numArr = [ 1, 2, 3];
const newArr = [...charArr, ...numArr] // ['a', 'b', 'c', 1, 2, 3]
```

4. **Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.**
```
const firstArr = [ 4, 5, 6];
const secondArr = [1, 2, 3, ...firstArr]; // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

5. **Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.**
```
const pokemon = {name: 'pikachu'};
const type = {type: 'electric'};

const pikachu = {...pokemon, ...type};
```

## How to Pass Functions Between Components

1. **In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?** The wording on this question is kind of confusing me because technically the first thing he does is create the function, but I have a feeling the correct answer is he gives the `<Person />` component a prop to take the function as its value. 

2. **In your own words, what does the `increment` function do?** The function takes an argument, `name`, and then iterates through an array of objects via the `.map()` method in order to find which object's `name` property matches the `name` argument. If/when it finds that match, it adds one to that object's `count` property. Each iterated object is then added to a local array, and then that local array is set as the new value of the `people` property in the component's `state`.

3. **How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?** Declare a method within the Component and then pass it to whatever child component as a prop. (e.g. <Component prop={this.method} />

4. **How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?** When a method is passed from a parent to a child component, the method can be accessed through the child component's `props`. Therefore, the method can be invoked by using `this.props.method`

## Things I Want To Know More About

- Is there a difference between the attributes 'id' and 'key'? Or are they functionally the same thing? Or is 'key' more of a React specific thing?
