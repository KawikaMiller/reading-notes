# Reading - Class 10

These notes will explain what a call stack is and how they function as well as explain the various error types and the basics of breakpoints.

## [Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/understanding-the-javascript-call-stack-861e41ae61d4)

1. **What is a ‘call’?** When we "use" a function, we are "calling" that function, which is just another way of saying "invoking" a function. For example when we use `console.log()` we are "calling" the `console.log()` function.

2. **How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?** When dealing with synchronous code, 'calls' are made one at a time. ~~When dealing with asynchronous code, many 'calls' can be made at the same time.~~ (not sure about asynchronous code)

3. **What does LIFO mean?** "Last in, First out". Meaning that the last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be popped out, when the function returns.

4. **Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.**

```
function firstFunction(){
  throw new Error('Stack Trace Error');
}

function secondFunction(){
  firstFunction();
}

function thirdFunction(){
  secondFunction();
}

thirdFunction();
```

5. **What causes a Stack Overflow?** A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point. The browser (hosting environment) has a maximum stack call that it can accomodate before throwing a stack error.

```
function callMyself(){
  callMyself();
}

callMyself();
```

## JavaScript Error Messages

1. **What is a ‘reference error’?** A reference error occurs when you try to access something that has not been declared yet, like a variable.

2. **What is a ‘syntax error’?** A syntax error occurs when there is something wrong with the syntax in your code, like a missing semi-colon or a comma.

3. **What is a ‘range error’?** A range error occurs when you try to manipulate an object with an invalid number value, like trying to give an array a length of -1.

4. **What is a ‘type error’?** A type error occurs when the data type of a variable you are trying to use or access is incompatible, like trying to access a property of a variable that is undefined.

5. **What is a breakpoint?** A breakpoint is a intentional stopping or pausing point in a program, put in place by developers for debugging purposes. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakpoint)

6. **What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?** It allows us to set a breakpoint in our code.

## Things I Want To Know More About

- (What does a call stack look like) / (how are call stacks handled) in regard to asynchronous code?
- If we add the word 'debugger' to our code and it gets pushed to production, will the breakpoint still trigger?
