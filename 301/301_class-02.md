# Reading - Class 02

These notes will help to explain the basics of the React component lifecycle as well as distinguish between State and Props.

## React Lifecycle

1. **Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?** The `.render()` method happens before `componentDidMount`

2. **What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?** The `constructor` method is the first thing that happens in a React component lifecycle

3. **Put the following things in the order that they happen: componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates** `constructor` > `render` > `React Updates` > `componentDidMount` > `componentWillUnmount`

4. **What does componentDidMount do?** `componentDidMount` is executed after the component is rendered and is typically a good place for us to load data / make a request from a remote api endpoint.

## React State vs. Props

1. **What types of things can you pass in the props?** You can pass any JavaScript value through props, like strings, numbers, objects, arrays, etc.

2. **What is the big difference between props and state?** Props are handled outside of the component while state is handled inside of the component.

3. **When do we re-render our application?** Our application is rerendered whenever there is a change made to the component's state.

4. **What are some examples of things that we could store in state?** If we wanted to have some kind of counter, that would be stored in state. Forms/inputs information would be another thing that state would be useful for.
