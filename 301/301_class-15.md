## [What is OAuth](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3216404/what-is-oauth-how-the-open-authorization-framework-works.html)

1. **What is OAuth?** OAuth is an open-standard authorization protocol or framework that describes how unrelated servers and services can safely allow authenticated access to their assets without actually sharing the initial, related, single logon credential. In authentication parlance, this is known as secure, third-party, user-agent, delegated authorization

2. **Give an example of what using OAuth would look like.** An example would be like when you go to log-in to a website and it offers you the ability to log-in / sign-up using your google account.

3. **How does OAuth work? What are the steps that it takes to authenticate the user?** 
	1. Website-A connects to Website-B with the user's credentials
	2. Website-B generates a one-time token and a one-time secret, unique to the transaction and the parties involved.
	3. Website-A gives this token and secret to the initiating user's client
	4. The client presents the one-time request token and secret to the authorization provider (which may or may not be Website-B)
	5. If not already authenticated to the authorization provider, the client may be asked to authenticate. After authentication, the client is asked to approve the authorization transaction to Website-B.
	6. The user approves (or their client silently approves) a transaction at Website-A.
	7. The user is given an approved **ACCESS** token (no longer a *request* token.
	8. The user gives the approved access token to Website-A
	9. Website-A gives the access token to Website-B as proof of authentication on behalf of the user
	10. Website-B lets Website-A access their site on behalf of the user
	11. The user sees a successful transaction occuring

4. **What is OpenID?** OpenID is for authentication of human users logging into machines.

## [Authorization and Authentication flows](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow)

1. **What is the difference between authorization and authentication?** *Authentication* is the process of verifying who a user is while *authorization* is the process of verifying what resources they have access to.

2. **What is Authorization Code Flow?** It is the process that occurs when a web app's back-end tries to verify/validate a user's log-in credentials. 

3. **What is Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)?** It is an additional layer of authentication to help prevent malicious applications/users from accessing a client secret &/o authorization code from the authorization server. It creates a secret called the `code verifier`  which is transformed by a `code challenge` and then sends over HTTPS in exchange for an `authorization code`. This way, a malicious attacker can only intercept the `authorization code` and cannot exchange that for an access token without the code verifier.

4. **What is Implicit Flow with Form Post?** The web app requests and obtains tokens through the front channel, without the need for secrets or extra backend calls. With this method, you donâ€™t need to obtain, maintain, use, and protect a secret in your application.

5. **What is Client Credentials Flow?** With machine-to-machine (M2M) applications, such as CLIs, daemons, or services running on your back-end, the system authenticates and authorizes the app rather than a user. For this scenario, typical authentication schemes like username + password or social logins don't make sense. Instead, M2M apps use the Client Credentials Flow (defined in [OAuth 2.0 RFC 6749, section 4.4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.4)), in which they pass along their Client ID and Client Secret to authenticate themselves and get a token.

6. **What is Device Authorization Flow?** With input-constrained devices that connect to the internet, rather than authenticate the user directly, the device asks the user to go to a link on their computer or smartphone and authorize the device. This avoids a poor user experience for devices that do not have an easy way to enter text. To do this, device apps use the Device Authorization Flow (ratified in [OAuth 2.0](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628)), in which they pass along their Client ID to initiate the authorization process and get a token.

7. **What is Resource Owner Password Flow?** Though we do not recommend it, highly-trusted applications can use the Resource Owner Password Flow (defined in [OAuth 2.0 RFC 6749, section 4.3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.3)), which requests that users provide credentials (username and password), typically using an interactive form. Because credentials are sent to the backend and can be stored for future use before being exchanged for an Access Token, it is imperative that the application is absolutely trusted with this information.
