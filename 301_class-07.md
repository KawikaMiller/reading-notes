These notes briefly summarize what the HTTP protocol is and how/why it is used

## [How I Explained REST to my Brother](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

1. **Who is Roy Fielding?** Roy Fielding is a computer scientist and one of the pricipal authors of the HTTP specification and the originator of REST [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Fielding). In other words, he helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser

2. **Why don’t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?** Because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines.

3. **What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?** HTTP—this protocol Fielding and his friends created—is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.

4. **What does a `GET` do?** Retrieves information/data/resources *from* a URL / endpoint / API / server

5. **What does a `POST` do?** Adds information/data/resources *to* a URL / endpoint / API / server

6. **What does `PUT` do?** Replaces information/data/resources in a URL / endpoint / API / server

7. **What does `PATCH` do?** Updates/Transforms information/data/resources in a URL / endpoint / API / server
